\cvsection{Experience}

\cvevent{Instructional Aid}{UCSD Computer Science and Engineering Department  }{December 2019 -- Ongoing}{San Diego, CA}
\begin{itemize}
\item Increased student retention of course material including recursion, data structures, and object-oriented programming through weekly discussion sections, tutoring sessions, and by giving in depth feedback on graded assignments

\item Designed and proctored labs, home works, and quizzes that provided students hands on practice with key software techniques and tools like GDB and Valgrind, Version Control System, the Linux environment, Makefiles, and Shell Scripting 

\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{Programmer}{JP Morgan Chase & Co Software Engineering Virtual Experience }{August 2020 -- September 2020}{Virtual}
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimized the monitoring of potential trade opportunities for the user by expanding the dashboard with visualizations. The visualizations showed the correlation between two stocks which better identified under/over-valued stocks

\item Used React and Node.js in order to collect the performance of two stocks from a financial data feed and Python to calculate the level of correlation between the stocks
\item I created an interface that uses  JP Morgan’s Perspective software technology to visualize the correlation between the stocks

\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Projects}

\cvevent{Model Selection Research}{}{December 2020}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyzed the performance of machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision trees by modeling the optimized algorithms onto three different data sets and used performance statistics like accuracy, precision, and variance to determine the best performing algorithm
\item Used Sklearn and Python to wrangle data and implement a five fold cross validation algorithm to optimize the hyper parameters of each algorithm for three different trials and used the most optimal hyper parameters from the three trials as the version of the algorithm to use for the comparisons
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{COVID-19 Research}{}{June 2020}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Determined that policy and demographics like insurance rate, population density, and quality of living of different US state
does not have significant effects on the overall number of COVID-19 cases in that state
\item Performed statistical and geo-spatial analysis on wrangled data using the Python libraries Pandas and Numpy to perform
linear regression and to visualize that state demographics don’t have significant impact on COVID-19 cases
\end{itemize}

    \item Provost Honors
\end{itemize}
\cvsection{Leadership}

\cvevent{Vice President}{Sikh Student Association}{October 2019 -- Ongoing}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Revitalized a student org that acted as a base for a strong community for Sikh and Punjabi students in the San Diego region
\item Continued to have virtual events during COVID lock down in order to keep high morals and establish a safe zone for people to rely on mentally and emothionally
\item Increased exposure to Sikhism in the San Diego area by organizing events, managing fundraisers, leading discussion, as well as creating a website to educate about the different aspects of the community  and to expand the community

\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Courses}
\begin{itemize}
\item Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms   
\item AI: Search and Reasoning   
\item Advanced Data Structures   
\item Data Science in Practice
\item Theory of Computation
\item Algorithm and System Analysis
\item Discrete Mathematics
\item Linear Algebra
