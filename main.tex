\cvevent{Programmer}{JP Morgan Chase & Co Software Engineering Virtual Experience }{August 2020 -- September 2020}{Virtual}
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimized the monitoring of potential trade opportunities for the user by expanding the dashboard with visualizations that showed the correlation between two stocks which better identified under/over-valued stocks

\item Used React and Node.js in order to collect the performance of two stocks from a financial data feed and Python to calculate the level of correlation between the stocks, I created an interface that uses  JP Morganâ€™s Perspective software technology to visualize the correlation between the stocks

\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Projects}

\cvevent{Model Selection Research}{}{December 2020}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysed the performance of different machine learning algorithms by modeling all of the data
onto three huge a different data sets and using their performance statistics to determine which one
was the overall best fit
\item Used Sklearn and Python to wrangle data and implement a five fold cross validation algorithm to optimize the hyper parameters of each algorithm for three different trials and used the most optimal versions of each algorithm to get the performance statistics
\end{itemize}
